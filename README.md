This was once part of a program that read health memory from Source engine video games, and then it would show the health on an RGB keyboard.

Thanks to archive.org, the original project files were recovered. The project is based on [this one](https://github.com/billism1/KeyboardAudio) which gave me the base framework to interface with the K70. The code to read memory was made through trial and error, finding memory offsets via Cheat Engine.

The result can be found on youtube
